Have you ever had your significant other going on a shopping frenzy?
Have you ever lived through those hard moments, but they've taken huge toll on your finances?
I certainly have and everytime hoped that it would never happen again.
Sometimes a man has to take bull by its horns and solve the problem himself.
Shopping blocker(TM) is your salvation, now you can sleep calmly and not worry about your SO's wardrobe getting destroyed!
